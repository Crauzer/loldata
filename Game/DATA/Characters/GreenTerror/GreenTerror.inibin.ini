Lore2="As time passed, she became the cause of much trouble in Jugo. People became afraid of Annie because of the sudden fires that erupted when the little girl was in a bad mood. Several years later, she threw a temper tantrum over a dropped teddy bear, and completely incinerated her parents and her home. She has since drifted aimlessly from town to town, sometimes becoming angry over a trivial matter at which point great fire storms erupt leaving only a crying orphan girl in their wake. When the darkness inside of her felt the first call of Chaos, it discovered befitting and truly sinister use for the Dark Child."
