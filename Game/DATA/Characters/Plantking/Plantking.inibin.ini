Lore2="As Gavd^s jungle of thorns and vines grew larger, it drew nearer and nearer to the tended gardens of the Demacians. Soon, human foresters arrived in Gavd^s territory. Wielding brutal axes, they began to slash their way through the jungle, destroying seedlings and woodland that had taken decades to grow. Soon, most of his friends and family had been destroyed, hacked into firewood and carried off by the uncaring humans. With the other plants around him wilting away, Gavd set off to vindicate his kingdom, joining the Immortal war with the intent of destroying the humans in the same violent manner as they had done to his kin."
