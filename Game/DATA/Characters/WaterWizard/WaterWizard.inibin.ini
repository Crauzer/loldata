Lore2="them below the thrashing waves until water filled the  poor soul^s lungs and he was rendered unconscious.  Soterios would then proceed to Rebirth the lost man by  bringing him back to shore, and pressing his holy hands  upon the victim^s chest until he was brought back  choking and coughing, Reborn into the world as acolytes  to the High Priest. For years Soterios conducted his Rituals of  Rebirth unchallenged. Grown fanatical in his success  with the Rituals, Soterios was sure in his belief that  his own Rebirth would result in a divine transformation of his body, elevating him to an even higher level of power. At a command from Soterios, his acolytes lowered  the High Priest into the cold, dark sea. Unfortunately, his Rebirth did not go as planned and as water filled his lungs, the dying High Priest made one last plea to the higher powers. Reborn by the Immortals, he renamed himself Well, the Hydrosoul, and lives only to do their bidding."
