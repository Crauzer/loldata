tr "game_character_lore_Voidwalker" = "There is a place between dimensions, between worlds.  To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown.  To most, however, it is called the Void. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things, horrors not meant for minds of men.  Though such knowledge is lost to the modern day, there are those who have unwittingly discovered what lies beyond and have been unable to turn away.  Kassadin is such a creature, a man forced to look upon the face of the Void and be forever changed by it.  Once a seeker of forbidden knowledge, he discovered that what he sought was something else entirely.  Though a part of him died that day, he knows that he must protect Valoran from the things scratching at the door, waiting to get in and visit their torments upon the world.  They are only one step away, something the appearance of the abomination known as Cho'gath attests.  Kassadin has harnessed the power of the Void.  His Nether Blade steals the magical energy of his opponents. This dark blade also allows him to fire ethereal bolts of Void energy, not only harming his enemies, but inhibiting their ability to utilize their mystical abilities.  Kassadin draws energy from others' magical use, charging him until he unleashes a force pulse that both damages and slows foes.  His connection with the Void also allows him to transform the damage he takes from other Champions, increasing the speed of his attacks.  Kassadin can also step sideways through the world, teleporting where he pleases.  He can utilize this rift-walking ability multiple times to deal more and more damage."

Born with the ability to freeze the very air around her, Nunu became invaluable to her small village as an igloo builder, creating blocks of ice to form the foundations for the village's buildings. One day, as Nunu sat patiently next to her fishing hole, she was startled by a massive, starving Yeti that burst from underneath the glacier and collapsed miserably next to her. Feeling pity for the poor, shivering beast, Nunu offered the Yeti a fish from her bucket. With wide eyes, the eager Yeti gobbled it down, feeling much better and the two became fast friends.</p>"
