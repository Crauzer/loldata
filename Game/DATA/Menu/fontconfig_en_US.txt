The combination of Annie's lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little girl tremendous arcane power.  At the age of two she miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet.

There really wasn't a place in the world for a sentient armadillo - except in the League of Legends.  His new form was certainly equipped to fight, and especially to defend.

As the Rune War devastated his homeland, he experimented with powerful temporal magic that he hoped would bring peace.

His consciousness now drifts through time, from any point he has already lived to the present.  Zilean's greatest curse is that he sometimes experiences Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins.

On her world, Anivia was the protector of the frozen wastes and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places.  She was consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had seen the world renewed several times.  Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled across worlds, and when that day came, she received the call with grace.

Tryndamere was born a member of one of these nomadic tribes, a large child of surprising strength.  One year, as his clan moved south between the Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers in black garb.  The elder went out to speak with them, but they cut him down mercilessly.  They then began the slaughter of every man, woman, and child in the clan.

By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of 38 charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.

Morgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of the angels, and for that she was branded ''fallen''.  Morgana was not innocent, having taken to the practice of the black arts in an effort to fight against the general of her enemy's army - her sister, Kayle, who had long ago disavowed any filial connection.  Then, as the two were locked in what might be their final conflict, they were suddenly summoned to Valoran.

This behemoth of a man has long eschewed the rigors of civilization for what he calls his slice of paradise; he has no neighbors to bother him and plenty of space to pursue his life's ambition - brewing.  Grogs, ales, meads, and wine - nothing is beyond his skill to brew.  What makes Gragas a truly special brewmaster, however, is his proximity to a large and powerful nexus.  The magic of this nexus has seeped into his fermented creations, and Gragas has consumed enough of his own poison over the years to slake the thirst of an army.  This arcane alcohol has caused Gragas to swell both in height and girth; he looms over the tallest of men and boasts nearly twice their width.  To complement his immoderate size, Gragas has developed an ornery temper - one fueled by liquor and raw magic.  His infrequent sojourns into Nexus for supplies always unfold the same way: Gragas enters a Noxian tavern, Gragas gets into several fights, Gragas lays out countless citizens, and finally Gragas flees for the foothills with Noxian constables in hot - though reluctant - pursuit.
